//String concatenation appends one string after the end of another string
//if operands are numbers, + performs additions. if both are strings or only one is a string, then + will perform concatenation

2 + 3
//output will be a number 

"2" + "3" 
//output will be a string 

"2" + 3
//output will be a string

//parseInt() and parseFloat() convert strings into numbers. Ex: 
parseInt("5") + 2
//same as 5 + 2
parseFloat("2.4") + 6
//same as 2.4 + 6

//for loop
//collects three parts — the loop variable initialization, loop condition, and loop variable update — all at the top of the loop
//A for loop executes the initialization expression, evaluates the loop's condition, and executes the loop body if the condition is true
//After the loop body executes, the final expression is evaluated, and the loop condition is checked to determine if the loop should execute again

//for loop structure 
for (initialization; condition; finalExpression) {
   body
}

//for loop example 
for (i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
   console.log(i);
}
console.log("Done!");
